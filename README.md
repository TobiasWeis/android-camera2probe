## Public repo discontinued

Dear all, due to some people just taking the code and publishing it under their name in the app store w/o asking, attribution, code-sharing or anything, I decided to move my development-code to a private repo.

If you do not want to rip me off, I am happy to share my current code with you and invite you to this new repo.
